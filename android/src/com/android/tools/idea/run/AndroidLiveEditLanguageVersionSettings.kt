 * A language version setting that delegates to an existing one except it does not enable LanguageFeature.InlineConstVals.
 *
 * This is a work around to not able to manually tell Kotlin's IR backend to not inline constant properties.
 *
 * We want to disable inline constant because of R.java values. The analysis uses a generated R.class with fake values
 * for autocomplete / resolution purpose. Should it be inlined in the currently editing class, the application will get
 * invalid index value.
