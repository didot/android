# This OWNERS file exists temporarily to reduce the risk of divergence from
# the code upstream in the Kotlin plugin, since android-kotlin code
# temporarily lives in both repositories, and JetBrains still wants
# to make nontrivial changes to it (mostly related to performance
# and multiplatform project support).
