/**
 * An interaction is a mouse or keyboard driven user operation, such as a swipe-select or a resize. It can be thought of as a session, since
 * it is initiated, updated during user manipulation, and finally completed or canceled. An interaction can have at most one undo
 * transaction (some interactions, such as a selection do not have a transaction), and an interaction can have a number of graphics [Layer]s
 * which are added and cleaned up on behalf of the interaction by the system.
 *
 * Unlike [Interaction], [Interaction2] uses [EventObject] as event interface so all events can be used to started, updated, ended, or
 * canceled. The implementation of [Interaction2] has to cast the received [EventObject] to its acceptable event such like [KeyEvent],
 * [MouseEvent], [MouseWheelEvent], [DropTargetDragEvent], [DropTargetEvent], or [DropTargetDropEvent] to perform the [begin], [update],
 * [commit], and [cancel] operations. This makes [Interaction2] can handle more than one kind of event. For example, a drag interaction can
 * also handle the [KeyEvent] during dragging. so it can apply different behavior when modifiers is pressed or released during interacting.
 *
 * TODO(b/142953949): Replace [Interaction] with this class.
