# Package com.android.tools.idea.common.property2.api

Defines the API of the property editing system.
The system is setup in a way to allow for reuse in different types properties.
Currently only an inspector style view is supported.

To use the property system a client should:
 - implement a customized [PropertyItem] that optionally can implement [ActionButtonSupport] and [HelpSupport]
 - implement a [PropertiesModel] which is capable of generating a table of properties
 - implement a [ControlTypeProvider] (unless a custom [EditorProvider] is used)
 - implement a [EnumSupportProvider] (unless a custom [EditorProvider] is used)
 - instantiate a [EditorProviderImpl] using the [ControlTypeProvider] and [EnumSupportProvider]
 - instantiate a [PropertiesView]
 - implement one or more [InspectorProvider]s using the [EditorProvider] and add them to the [PropertiesView]

 The PropertyItem is generic such that the client can reference their own types in the [InspectorProvider] implementations.
