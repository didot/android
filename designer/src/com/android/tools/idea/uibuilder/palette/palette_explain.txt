These components should NOT be on the palette:
===============================================
MediaController -      This component should be instantiated in code. Does not work when included in XML.
Gallery         -      This component was deprecated in API level 16
ExtractEditText -      This component is a specialization of EditText rendered on devices in landscape mode.
TwoLineListItem -      This component was deprecated in API level 17.

The following components were removed because they're considered obsolete
(not commonly used, and just adds clutter and confusion to the menu) :
- GestureOverlayView, DialerFilter, ZoomButton, ZoomControls, Chronometer, the clocks

TODO: Consider removing transition widgets.
