 * A [LightVirtualFile] defined to allow quickly identifying the given file as an XML that is used as adapter to be able to preview custom
 * entities.
 * The contents of the file only reside in memory and contain some XML that will be passed to Layoutlib.
 *
 * Historically, design tools were only able to preview xml layouts. Each preview corresponded to a single layout and a layout corresponded
 * to a xml file. The internal logic of [com.android.tools.idea.common.model.NlModel] and Layoutlib heavily relies on this and that is why
 * we pretend there is a xml file that backs each preview.
 *
 * TODO(b/227474522): Consider making this generic type so that clients do not need subclass but use a specified generic instead.
