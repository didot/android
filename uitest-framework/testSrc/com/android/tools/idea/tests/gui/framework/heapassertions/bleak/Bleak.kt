/**
 * BLeak checks for memory leaks by repeatedly running a test that returns to its original state, taking
 * and analyzing memory snapshots between each run. It looks for paths from GC roots through the heap that
 * terminate in objects that are consistently growing (i.e., have an increasing number of outgoing
 * references) each iteration.
 *
 * Initially, all non-primitive arrays are marked as potentially growing, since these are the only objects
 * that can theoretically grow indefinitely. On subsequent iterations, the shortest path to each growing
 * object in the previous iteration is found, and the corresponding path is followed (if it exists) in the
 * new graph. If the degree of the node at the tip of this path has increased, it is marked as growing in
 * the new graph. This process whittles down the set of consistently growing nodes (called "leak roots"),
 * ideally discarding any growth unrelated to the operations under test.
 *
 * Finally, the leak roots are evaluated for severity. Currently two similar metrics are available:
 * retained size and "leak share". Leak share is like retained size, except objects that are reachable via
 * multiple leak roots (but are not reachable from non-leak roots) have their size contribution split
 * equally among the roots from which they're reachable.
 *
 * Based on "BLeak: Automatically Debugging Memory Leaks in Web Applications" by John Vilk and Emery D. Berger
