          <h1>Support for Dynamic Apps</h1>

          Dynamic Apps is an easier way to update and deploy your app to an ever-growing ecosystem of
          diverse Android devices. With Dynamic Apps, you need to build and upload only a single build artifact,
          the <b>Android App Bundle</b>, to support all target device configurations.
          <br><br>
          App stores that support Dynamic Apps—such as the Google Play Store—build, sign, and manage APKs for all
          versions of your app for you, and push only the code and resources a device requires to run your app.
          Updates to Android Studio and the <a href="https://d.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin.html">
          Android Plugin for Gradle</a> allow you to configure your app project to take advantage of Dynamic
          Apps and build Android App Bundles.

          <br><br>
          To learn more about how to configure your project to support Dynamic Apps, read the following
          documentation in a browser.

          <h1>Navigation Editor</h1>

          The Navigation Editor lets you visualize and edit navigation behavior between different components
          and activities in your app, so you can better assess whether navigation flows are correct and easy
          for users to understand. To learn more, <a href="https://d.android.com">read the documentation</a>
          in a browser.

          <h1>New Energy Profiler</h1>

          <a href="https://d.android.com/studio/profile/android-profiler.html">The Android Profiler</a>
          <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/images/buttons/toolbar-android-profiler.png" width="16" height="16">
          now includes an <a href="https://d.android.com/studio/profile/android-profiler.html">Energy Profiler</a>
          to help you assess the energy consumption of your app. This profiler visualizes your app's battery usage
          and allows you to inspect which device components—such as network radios or the CPU—are consuming the
          most energy.

          <h1>New Code Shrinker</h1>

          R8 is a new tool for code shrinking and obfuscation that replaces ProGuard. You can start using a
          <b>preview</b> version of R8 by including the following in your project’s
          <code>gradle.properties</code> file:
          <br><br>
          <pre>  android.enableR8 = true</pre>
