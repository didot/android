              is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. The toolkit also brings all of
              Kotlin's benefits, such as helping you to write concise and idiomatic code that's
              fully interoperable with Java.
              <br><br>
              When using Android Studio to develop your app with Jetpack Compose, you benefit from
              smart editor features, such as a New Project template, code completion enhancements,
              and a live preview of your Compose UI.
