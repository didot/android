              A new Upgrade Assistant for Android Gradle plugin can help you update
              the AGP version for your project.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>Built on top of the existing AGP upgrade functionality, this tool guides you
              through project-wide updates/refactorings and includes a preview of the
              updates to help prevent potential breaking changes before executing the AGP
              upgrade.
              </p>

              <p><b>Query editor</b></p>
              <br>
              <p>The Database Inspector has been updated to help you
              write and execute your custom SQL statements. When
              you open the inspector and open a <b>New query</b> tab, you should notice a
              larger, resizable editor surface to author and format your queries, as
              shown below.
              </p>

              <br><br>
              <p>Additionally, we now provide history of your previous queries. When you click on the
              <b>Show query history</b> <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/images/buttons/db-inspector-query-history.png">
              button, you should see a list of queries you previously ran against the currently
              selected database. Click a query in the list to see a preview of the full
              query in the editor and press <b>Enter</b> to copy it to the editor. Then,
              click <b>Run</b> to execute the statement.
              </p>

              <p><b>Offline mode</b></p>
              <br>
              <p>We've added the ability to keep
              inspecting your app's databases after a process disconnects, making it easier
              to debug your app after a crash. While offline, you can open and query tables.
              However, you cannot edit values or run modification statements until you reconnect
              to an app process.

            <br />
            <ul>
              <li><b>Events Table:</b> Displays all trace events in the currently selected thread.

                        <li><b>BufferQueue:</b> In the Display section, this new track shows the
                          buffer count of the app's surface BufferQueue (0, 1 or 2).
                          <br />

                        <li><b>CPU Frequency:</b> In the CPU cores section, this track
                          shows how hard each core is working.

             <br /><br />
              <p>Introduced in Android Studio 4.0, the Layout Inspector was designed for
                real-time inspection of your running app's UI stack.
                However, you might not always want the Layout Inspector
                to immediately reflect what's happening in your app, since you might want to
                inspect a snapshot of your app's layout at a specific point in time or
                minimize the performance impact of live updates on your app.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>To manually load a snapshot of UI data from your app, first disable the
                <b>Live updates</b> option. You can then click the <b>Refresh</b> <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/images/buttons/live-layout-refresh-icon.png">
                button to take a new snapshot of the UI stack for inspection. The Layout
                Inspector now remembers your preference to keep <b>Live updates</b> enabled or
                disabled between sessions.
