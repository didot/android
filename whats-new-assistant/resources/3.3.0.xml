           Click <b>File &gt; Project Structure</b> to use the improved Project Structure dialog, which now allows you to better manage
           build variants and their properties; visualize the dependency graph of each module; verify that dependencies are up-to-date; and
           more.

            <![CDATA[
           For projects that configure multiple build variants, you can now optimize project syncs to run only on the build variant you
           currently have selected.

           <br><br>
           If the IDE doesn't prompt you to enable this optimization, enable it manually by navigating to
           <b>Settings/Preferences &gt; Experimental &gt; Gradle</b> and checking the box next to <b>Only resolve selected variants</b>.

           If you've already opted into sharing usage statistics to help improve Android Studio, you'll see these two new icons in the
           status bar at the bottom of the IDE window:
           <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/images/buttons/statusbar-feedback_buttons-dark.png" width="40" height="16">

           <br><br>
           Simply click the icon that best represents your current experience with the IDE. When you do so, the IDE sends usage statistics
           that allows the Android Studio team to better understand your sentiment.
