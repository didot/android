/**
 * An action that can display a checkmark to indicate it is selected.
 *
 * This class is based on [com.intellij.openapi.actionSystem.ToggleAction]. ToggleAction isn't quite suited for this. It is very well suited
 * for an action that you click to set, and click again to unset. But these work differently. You click to set but clicking again does not
 * unset. It's possible to use it but results in awkward code.
 * It's especially awkward with [LogcatFormatCustomViewAction] because that action needs to also open a dialog when clicked.
