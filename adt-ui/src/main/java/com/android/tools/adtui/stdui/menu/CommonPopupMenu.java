 * TODO currently this class does nothing more than changing colors and borders.
 * The reason we need this is because {@link JMenu} does not expose its internal popup menu used for showing sub-menus, and thus there is no
 * way for us to control its style. The current solution essentially duplicates the {@link JMenu} implementation into {@link CommonMenu},
 * changing the internal logic to instantiate this {@link CommonPopupMenu} instead, where we can control the style. A better solution might
 * be to go through the laf system instead, which would eliminate the need to duplicate/subclass the entire menu chain.
